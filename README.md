# PhotoBooth

#### By ** Mwangi Margaret
## Description
 It is an app that will access a deviceâ€™s camera, record the video stream, add a background, and allow the user to take a screenshot and download it. The background manipulation is still a work in progress but as of now, I have been able to implement the video stream, screenshot, and download functionality.
